## About
This folder contains different tools/utilities rewritten from scratch in different programming languages. For example, there is a custom implementation of the `wc` command line tool written in Python and Go. These are for learning purposes and practice.

These projects come from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro)

## Projects
Each project will have it's own **README** with the instructions on how to recreate the utility and how to run each reimplementation.
